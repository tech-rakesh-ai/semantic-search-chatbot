# Semantic Search and Conversational ChatBot with Google Gemini & Elasticsearch

This project is a web-based application that allows you to upload employee data in JSON format, store it in Elasticsearch, and perform semantic search and conversation using Google Geminiâ€™s Generative AI (LLM) through LangChain. The application is built using **Streamlit** for the user interface.

## Key Features

1. **Employee Data Storage in Elasticsearch**: 
   - Upload employee data in JSON format.
   - Store the data in an Elasticsearch index for future retrieval.
   - Each record is embedded using Google's Gemini AI model for efficient similarity-based search.

2. **Semantic Search & Conversational AI**: 
   - Ask questions about the employee data.
   - Use Google Gemini's Generative AI (ChatGoogleGenerativeAI) for question-answering.
   - The system retrieves relevant records from Elasticsearch using similarity search and provides answers based on the retrieved data.

3. **Real-time Conversational Interface**:
   - Chat interface for user interaction.
   - Maintains conversation history and offers continuous interaction with context-aware responses.
   - Embeds user questions and provides responses using the **ConversationalRetrievalChain** from LangChain.

## How It Works

### 1. **Upload Employee Data**:
   - The application allows you to upload a JSON file containing employee data.
   - It verifies that the uploaded file contains a list of records and processes each record for embedding and storage in Elasticsearch.

### 2. **Embedding Data into Elasticsearch**:
   - After uploading the data, users can click the "Embed Data" button to process and store the employee records in Elasticsearch.
   - The application uses Google Gemini's Embedding model (`embedding-001`) to convert the records into embeddings, enabling efficient similarity-based retrieval.
   - Each record is added to Elasticsearch with its embedding, and the progress is displayed with a progress bar.

### 3. **Conversational AI**:
   - Users can ask questions related to the stored employee data through the chat interface.
   - The application uses **ConversationalRetrievalChain** to retrieve relevant information from Elasticsearch and provide answers.
   - It maintains chat history and continues to build context through conversation.

### 4. **Session Memory**:
   - The application maintains chat history using **ConversationBufferMemory** to ensure continuity in conversation.
   - This allows the chatbot to reference previous questions and answers during the conversation.

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: For building the user interface and handling user interactions.
- **LangChain**: For connecting the LLM (Google Gemini AI) and Elasticsearch for embedding and retrieval.
  - `GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings`: Embedding the employee data.
  - `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI`: Using Google Gemini's `gemini-1.5-pro` model for conversational AI.
  - `ConversationalRetrievalChain`: Handles conversation flow and retrieval from Elasticsearch.
- **Elasticsearch**: Stores the employee data with embeddings for efficient similarity-based search.
- **Google Gemini Pro API**: Provides the LLM (Language Model) capabilities for embedding and conversational AI.
- **dotenv**: For loading environment variables (API keys, Elasticsearch credentials).

## How to Use

### 1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tech-rakesh-ai/semantic-search-chatbot.git
cd semantic-search-chatbot
```

### 2. **Install the Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. **Set up Environment Variables**
Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add your API keys and Elasticsearch credentials:
```
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key
ES_URL=https://your_elasticsearch_url
ES_USER=your_elasticsearch_username
ES_PASSWORD=your_elasticsearch_password
INDEX_NAME=your_index_name
```

### 4. **Run the Application**
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### 5. **Upload Employee Data**
- Once the app is running, use the sidebar to upload a JSON file containing employee data.
- The data should be in the format of a list of JSON objects (records).

### 6. **Start Chatting**
- After embedding the data, use the chat interface to ask questions about the uploaded employee data.
- The chatbot will provide intelligent, context-aware responses based on the data.

## Sample Employee Data JSON

The uploaded JSON file should contain a list of employee records in the following format:
```json
[
  {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "position": "Software Engineer",
    "age": 30,
    "department": "IT"
  },
  {
    "name": "Jane Smith",
    "position": "Data Scientist",
    "age": 28,
    "department": "Data Science"
  }
]
```

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure your Google API key and Elasticsearch credentials are correctly configured in the `.env` file.
- Make sure the uploaded JSON file contains a valid list of records.

## Logging

The application uses Python's `logging` library to log information for debugging purposes. The logging level is set to `DEBUG`. You can change the logging level in the `app.py` file if needed.
